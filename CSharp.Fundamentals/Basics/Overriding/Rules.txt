The method signature of a derived class should be the same as a base class.
Overriding is not possible in the same class.
Access modifiers must be the same for virtual methods and override methods.
The virtual keyword is used in the base class method and Override is used in a derived class method.
The base class method should not be static.


Overriding in C# is the re-implementation of a base class method in a derived class. In this, the base class method is overridden in child class. 
The derived class method has the same name and signature as base class method. 
Overriding is useful in achieving Runtime polymorphism.

Overriding is useful in runtime polymorphism. It allows derived class to implement a base class method in its own way. 
So the method implementation is different of derived class from its base class. 
The overridden method can be virtual, override or abstract.
